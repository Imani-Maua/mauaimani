# Maua Imani

**HeyImani** is my digital introduction, not only as a software engineer, but also as a quirky, fun-loving, young spirit who happens to love pink quite a lot. Through HeyImani, I showcase who I am, what I build, what I am building, and hopefully, it encourages us to connect!

## ✨ Fun Features

### 1. 🎡 Interactive Favorites Carousel (`src/components/Favorites`)
A custom-built carousel featuring auto-sliding logic, manual navigation buttons, and touch-gesture support for mobile users.
- **Circular Logic**: Uses modulo arithmetic to ensure seamless infinite looping.
- **Micro-Animations**: Glassmorphism effects and subtle hover scales enhance engagement.

### 2. 📱 Mobile-First Glassmorphic Navbar (`src/components/Navbar`)
A unique 🌸 flower-triggered navigation menu designed for one-handed modern mobile use. My name means flower. A flower was more fitting than a hamburger menu.
- **Glassmorphism**: Uses `backdrop-filter` for a sleek, translucent overlay.
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions for menu expansion and link hover states.
